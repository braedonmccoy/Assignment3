1.Analysis
	A. No because a train system needs a circular queue to be effective. It is kind of effective, but not nearly as effective as it could be.
	B. Queues could be appropriate for Bank lines, sandwich shops and auto-body shops. You could use a queue to order the people in the lines for a teller, the ingredients on a sandwich being made, and a lot of cars to be fixed.

2. Summary
	A.
		i. We divided up the work by checking each other’s work and suggesting ideas for each other. We work well as a team.
		ii. My contribution was some of the actual code. I worked on creating the ADT and implementing it.
		iii. We all worked together in the same room, so code changes were easily managed verbally.
		iV.Working with a team made this project much simpler and more manageable.
	B. We had trouble with the train stations, but we were able to figure it out. The program should run as expected.
	C. I learned that trains are fairly simple, once you figure them out.
